# A fuzzy system control application  for a medical prediction
In medicine the use of tools that are children of artificial intelligence studies will be more and more frequent. One of the branches of AI, present since 1974, when Seto Assilian and Ebrahim H. Mamdani developed, in Great Britain, the first control system of a steam generator, based on fuzzy logic. 
Intelligent control is performed with the help of Fuzzy Logic as a tool. Fuzzy Logic enables the development of rule-based behaviour. The knowledge of an expert can be coded in the form a rule-base and used in decision making. The main advantage of Fuzzy Logic is that it can be tuned and adapted if necessary, thus enhancing the degree of freedom of control. 
The main objective of this project is to develop an expert system based on fuzzy logic. For to verify the functioning of the application we took as an example of the studies on the prediction of diabetes with a fuzzy logic control system.
